In this version, there's a new special game mode: Defense.

Defense Mode, and the Tutorial, can be found under Special...
<--- Here.

In Defense Mode, you start in a chosen location, and have to
fight off increasingly difficult waves of enemies.  There is a
generator nearby which you have to defend.
To aid you, there are regular caravans from which you can buy
supplies.  Additionally, crafting performs much, much faster.

It's relatively easy to add new game modes.  Read the
code_doc/GAMEMODES file for instructions on the basic, and
check out defense.cpp for some examples.
